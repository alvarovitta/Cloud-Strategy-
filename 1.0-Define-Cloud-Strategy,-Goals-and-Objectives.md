To be successful in migrating workloads to a private/public cloud or to modern end-state data centers, organizations need to build this capability by putting in place a Cloud Center of Excellence.   The first step is to identify why an organization wants to embrace cloud and answer the following questions: 


   - What is the purpose of moving the workloads to the cloud? 

   - What are the business outcomes the organization wants to achieve by leveraging cloud? 



## Establish strategy and goals 

Every journey must have a sense of its destination, its route, and when it will arrive. A migration journey to the cloud is no different. It is time well spent to engage senior members of IT—and, indeed, business leaders from around the enterprise—to understand all aspects of the cloud and which of the many options and approaches to take. 


Business & IT leaders are brought together to identify business goals & learn how modernization can help drive progress toward those goals.

The Cloud Strategy will drive the foundational and operational requirements that need to be in place to enable the workloads and operate them in the cloud.  These components include: 

**Foundation - include description of Foundation layer**  
**Operational - include description of Operational layer**
**Workloads - include description of Operational layer**

Business goals are reviewed and mapped to the workloads that support them. In addition, the initiatives that are already in progress and the transformational activities are reviewed and analyzed against the current workload roadmap to see how it supports those initiatives. 


## Objectives 

An organization needs to determine what outcomes and value they will get from moving workloads to the cloud. Determining that will help to define which workloads will go to the cloud and how to prioritize them through a program of change or roadmap. Having defined the Cloud strategy and goals, an organization is ready to initiate the process of assessing those workloads for suitability and deployment to the cloud. 

Here we outline some sample objectives and how they relate to a cloud migration strategy.  An organization should already have these documented in their Cloud Strategy before initiating workload migration initiatives.

The objectives are used as input into the assessment and will help to determine the best cloud service model for each workload or application. 


## Scope 


The Set Scope and Goals phase is the first phase of the Portfolio Assessment engagement and it contains the following two activities 

  - **Define Scope and Approach:** focusing on a certain portion of the application portfolio and a certain set of target migrations; this requires an initial review and segmentation of the portfolio 
  - **Review Industry Trends and Identify Migration Goals** 


The following areas should be defined in order to define the scope and approach for the assessment: 

### Pain Points & Strategic Context Setting  

Validate pain points (such as operational efficiency, provide access to diversity of devices, cost effective scale, capacity for seasonal or unpredicted bursts) business drivers, and objectives for application portfolio migration to the cloud.  Translate business objectives into an informed application migration plan for cloud, based on relevant strategic models, competitive, industry and technology insights. 


### Enterprise Scenarios 

Scenario planning techniques to help build target state and events that may likely impact the business. Identify underlying assumptions and core underpinnings to developing successful Use enterprise scenarios specific to Cloud Migration to help build target state and events that may likely impact the business and/or what the organization wants to do. Determine potential solution options to business problems, and how strategies could be enhanced utilizing the cloud. 

### Strategic Questionnaire 

Determine priorities that are aligned to each enterprise scenario and key performance indicators the organization currently has in place and/or desires to improve and/or implement. 

### Capability Diagnostic 

Validate and compare organizational capabilities with industry proven practices, identify people, process and technology capability improvements specific to application portfolio assessment and cloud migration planning, and evaluate the value of the IT portfolio for the enterprise. 

### Portfolio Matrix 

Rationalize current application portfolio to ensure alignment to Cloud Migration scenarios & goals. Determine sources of project data (business strategies, IT strategies, macroeconomics). Conduct interviews with portfolio/project managers. Evaluate applications based on characteristics such as workload, architecture, financial, risks, operations, security and compliance. Segment application portfolio aligning to Gartner’s 5 Rs. Prioritize applications to migrate based on degree of benefits vs. ease of migration. 


### Strategic Vision 

Facilitate focused Portfolio Assessment and Cloud Migration sessions/workshops to highlight key strategic themes, proven practices and approaches to generate agreement on an informed path forward. Assess the application portfolio to determine an optimized cloud migration plan: Profile applications within the portfolio based on key characteristics. Segment applications by optimal migration path. Prioritize segments based on business migration objectives. Prioritize applications within segments to optimize the migration plan. 



## Proven Practices 

  - Creation of a Cloud Center of Excellence, a team, to establish a practice for continuously evaluating and experimenting to determine the appropriate platform and destination for each application 


  - Development of a Cloud Strategy Document with goals, timeframe, recommended strategy and expected benefits and outcomes prior to undertaking workload migration 


  - Engage other IT groups and selected Lines of Business - Enterprise Architecture, Information Security and Risk Management, Data Classification, Finance, Operations, Human Resources, Application Teams, impacted Lines of Business
