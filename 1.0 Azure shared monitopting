Overview

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is an Azure offering which reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing a Kubernetes cluster by offloading it to Azure. As a managed service, AKS does not provide detailed built-in monitoring.

As the same time, Customers will need to be concerned about these services as since they can affect container health and workloads.  Customized Kubernetes monitoring for AKS must integrate with the overall Azure Monitoring tools.
